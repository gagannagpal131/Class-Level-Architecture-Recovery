# Class-Level-Architecture-Recovery
Basic Class Level Overview of the  C++ source code.



**This code is intended for class level architecture recovery.<br />**
**The aim is to provide a basic class level view of the  C++ source code for better understanding of the user.<br/>**
C++ code (txt file) is taken as input and scanned line by line.<br />
The class hierarchy is shown as the output<br/>

**NOTE:**
1.) Code is designed for class level architecture recovery and does not take class members into account.<br/>
Each class is considered as atomic entity in this code. 

2.) Code is not designed for C++ files with Hybrid or Multilevel inheritance.

3.) Delimiter used in the code is a space (" "). Hence, the C++ code need's to be properly spaces (as shown in demo txt files) for this code to work properly.<br/>

**Sample Output (demo3.txt file):**<br/>
